   <p> My hobby is Reading, I Read Books in my free time. Reading helps me relax and stops me from getting bored. I like to Read All Type Of Books. Reading helps you understand past and present events better. This is something that is good to do after school or whenever you are bored. Reading is something that I like and it is fun. You can easily read books with a few online reading books apps, kindle, and more. 

       Reading is the process of taking in the sense or meaning of letters, symbols, etc., especially by sight or touch.
